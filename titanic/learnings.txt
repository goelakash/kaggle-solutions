1. Using multinomial feature (x E (1,2,3,...)) gives slightly higher accuracy than using multiple binomial features (feature -> one-hot vector)
2. Adding composite features (eg family_size) increases accuracy
3. Adding title reduced accuracy
4. Adding isAlone increased validation-score, but not test-score
5. isAlone, title and family-size together increased both val and test score!
6. Adding deck information increases val-score accuracy immensely, but reduces test-score!
  a) Using randomForestClassifier gave slightly better test-score, on the expense of validation-score
7. Just replacing C with S in 'Embarked' feature imputation causes the score to sky-rocket!!
8. Imputing age and fare data using title and pclass attribute respectively gives higher accuracy that simply using MICE algo
